#### I'm Sofia and this is my personal blog repo 👩‍💻

## Wonder how I build this website?

I used a simple Gatsby starter called the [the plain gatsby](https://the-plain-gatsby.netlify.com/). In order to build it there are some very simple three steps: `ceate`, `start` and just get to the `editing` part.

## Quick Start 🚀

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    If you want to go for the same approach as me. Just use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter, in this case `the-plain-gatsby`.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the-plain-gatsby starter
    gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/wangonya/the-plain-gatsby
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/about.md`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

    Edit `gatsby.config.js` to update site metadata.

    Add blog posts in markdown in `src/pages/blog/`. Each blog should have a `title` and `date` frontmatter. Example blog posts have been provided.
