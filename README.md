# Hi there! 👋 
#### I'm Sofia and this is my personal blog repo 👩‍💻

## Wonder how I build this website?

I used a simple Gatsby starter called the [the plain gatsby](https://the-plain-gatsby.netlify.com/). In order to build it there are some very simple three steps: `ceate`, `start` and just get to the `editing` part.

## If you would like to run the project locally you can follow these steps 🚀

### Prerequisites
- **Gatsby CLI:** The Gatsby CLI is available via npm and is installed globally by running `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

1.  **Install depedencies**

    ```sh
    # install the dependencies found on the package.json file
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Start the development server. More information about local [development](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli#develop)

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    My website is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Edit `gatsby.config.js` to update site metadata.

    Add blog posts in markdown in `src/pages/blog/`. Each blog should have a `title` and `date` frontmatter. Example blog posts have been provided.
