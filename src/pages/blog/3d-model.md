#### I am working on a 3D model of the clock frame with Mecabricks. Here you can find an interactive version:

<model-viewer id="lego-frame-model" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/maker-blog-assets/3d-model/clock-frame.glb" alt="A 3D model a Lego clock frame" camera-controls auto-rotate ar></model-viewer>

I wanted to build it because I am curious about having a record of the model I created. An easier way to share what I have built so someone else could do something similar.

## How am I building it?
I am currently working on this 3D model build with Mecabricks. If you haven't heard about it, Mecabricks is a great tool for build 3D models made with legos. You have a full list of pieces identify by piece ID and you can customize them with color and textures.

**Are you starting to feel curious about Mecabricks? Start playing around with it.**
It is completely free: [Mecabricks](https://www.mecabricks.com/)

Inside Mecabricks you can also find rendering features. The first round of renders is completely free after a certain amount you will have to pay for your render or decide to continue the next day since you have a fixed number of render that are for free every day.
