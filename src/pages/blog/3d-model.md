#### I created a 3D model of the clock frame with Mecabricks. Here you can find an interactive 3D model: 

<model-viewer id="lego-frame-model" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/maker-blog-assets/3d-model/clock-frame.glb" alt="A 3D model a Lego clock frame" camera-controls auto-rotate></model-viewer>

I was curious about having a record of the model I created. A easier way to share what I have build so someone else could build something similar.

## 3D Model
I am currently working on this 3D model build with Mecabricks. If you haven't heard about it, Mecabricks is a great tool for build 3D models made with legos. You have a full list of pieces identify by piece ID and you can customize them with color and textures.

##### This is a work in progress so come back later to see the final result!
