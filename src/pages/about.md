**I'm a Frontend Developer and UI Designer driven by curiosity.** I’m an
eager learner that became passionate about building what I can create as a designer.

My biggest hobby is swimming so most of my free time you will find me doing some laps at the pool I also like bike riding 🚴🏻‍♀️🍃

I'm very interested in "creative" programming so I
spend some of my free time learning: Processing, VR, Arduino and electronics. And I am
a big fan of Legos.
